"""Natural language interface to the BrowserAgent.

This script builds on top of the simple `BrowserAgent` class from
`agent.py` and integrates with OpenAIâ€™s ChatCompletion API to plan actions
from arbitrary user requests.  The assistant receives a request in natural
language, asks a language model to map it to one of the supported browser
commands, and then executes the corresponding action.

To use this assistant you must set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment
variable to a valid OpenAI API key.  See https://platform.openai.com/ for
details.

Example usage:

    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    python assistant_agent.py chrome

    Ask me anything: search Python tutorials

The assistant will ask OpenAI to interpret the request and then run the
appropriate browser command.
